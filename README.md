Classic Asteroids Game made to implement more realistic physics using simple equations to apply forces on objects. 
- The gravitational constant is extremly exaggerated to provide better quality gameplay and can be adjusted from the CONST script.
- More feature soon to be added including an enemy spaceship with a possible integration of some sort of AI to control the actions of the enemy.
